setup-rwgc
==========

Command for setting up rwgc in a RedwoodJS project

Setup
-----

```
yarn dlx setup-rwgc
```

Run the command above inside your Redwood project and it'll setup [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for you in a way that's tailor-made for Redwood.

Usage
-----

Inside your Redwood project you can now use the `rwgc` command to generate components.

For example, the command below will generate a button component

```
yarn rwgc button
```

Note
----

Currently this only works for TS projects. (Also see below ðŸ˜‰)

Contributing
------------

If you want to add JS support, or contribute any other changes an easy way to test this locally is:
```
yarn start --cwd ../rw-example-project --force
```

### Releasing

It's made to be released by npm (e.g. `npm run release:patch`). That way I don't have to worry about yarn v1 vs v3
